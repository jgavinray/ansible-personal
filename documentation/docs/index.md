## What is this?
I have a home lab and this is the automation that I use to manage my deployment. 
Specifically this collection of [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) [yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) files that do an initial and incremental configuration management on my hardware.

## Ummm if you already know what your doing why are you writing this?
Because I'm tired, I work full time, I can't remember when I did things or why, this [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) is where I store my state at a given moment.
